# graduation_project
graduation project,PID controller based on BPNN


contains matlab files and python files


matlab files are uesed to solve the motion of the ship under different conditions(both the sea and PD gains)
python files mainly have two classes,one for regular waves, one for random waves
there are also some other small files which used to plot、calculate wave force&torque
The proposed motion solve files are ordered by python,so the some steps should be done to carried out：
Windows：
cd "matlabroot\extern\engines\python"
python setup.py install
Mac/Linux：
cd "matlabroot/extern/engines/python"
python setup.py install
其中 matlabroot是安装matlab文件的本地地址，而且是特定版本文件夹下
